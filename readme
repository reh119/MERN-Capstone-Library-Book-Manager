Front END:

1.) List Books and List checked out/in books exclusively
to run: mongoDBassign/frontend/client, then "npm start" to start the server (starting on port http://localhost:8000))
Database updated with 11 books, 10 of which are available to check out
-To list out books, click the link: 'List Books'
-To list out checked out books or checked in books (avail/not avail), simply use the form underneath 'Status'
header on the table. Typing 'f' will list only checked out books (avail = false).
typing 't' will list out only the books still checked in (avail = true).
typing 'f' will list out all books that are false (checked out, avail = false)
This was done using the React Table feature, can adjust rows being shown, incase database grows.

//
2.) Update/Checkout/Checkin Feature
-Right hand side of the table, theres a button to update.

- click the button to update the availlibility of a book, which is the action of checking it in our out for someone
- after the update book comes up, I was not able to complete the functionality to update a book to be checkout or in (last feature)
